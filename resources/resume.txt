Responsibilities or duties:
• Published 5 IEEE papers showcasing the impact of our research methods for advancing AI in Medicine.
• Developed and fine-tuned Multi-modal LLMs for medical image captioning using PyTorch, integrating images
with diagnostic text, achieving a 13.4% higher BLEU4 over VisionGPT, with just 440M parameters, and
reducing inference time to 1.6 sec per image.
• Designed various medical image classification models for diagnosing chronic diseases such as schizophrenia, diabetic
retinopathy, breast cancer, and colon cancer using specific imaging modalities with 5%–7% lower false negatives.
• Enabled high-performance computing for training deep learning models through Slurm job scheduling,
optimizing resource allocation and accelerating processing times.
